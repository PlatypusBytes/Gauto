In this project together with @Bruno we are testing GAN's to see how they perform in filling in missing data.
As a first test a 3d block of IC values is created. A percentage of the 3d block is cropped and then the GAN
is trained to fill in the blanks.
The method is based on the paper and code of J. Yoon ().
